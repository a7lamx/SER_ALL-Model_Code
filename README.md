# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Model
This repository implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model that integrates a Co-Attention mechanism to enhance feature fusion across multiple models. The architecture is inspired by the original transformer-cnn-emotion-recognition repository by Ilia Zenkov, with significant improvements and extensions.
#📌 Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model that utilizes advanced deep learning techniques for emotion classification in speech. The key features of this implementation are:

Co-Attention Mechanism: A novel feature fusion technique that combines multiple model outputs for better performance.
Multi-Dataset Application: The model is evaluated on three diverse datasets, namely ASVP-ESD V1, ASVP-ESD V2, and ShEmo.
Feature Extraction: Combines MFCC and Mel spectrograms to improve emotion recognition accuracy.
🔍 Inspired by: transformer-cnn-emotion-recognition by Ilia Zenkov.
